# strtuctalign_local
Program for alignment of DNA-protein complexes.

Program StructAlign inputs a pair of complexes of DNA double helix with proteins and outputs an alignment of DNA chains corresponding to the best spatial fit of the protein chains. StructAlign is developed and maintained by a team from A.N. Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology MSU and Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics MSU. 

StructAlign requires find_pair from x3dna suit (https://x3dna.org) for correct work.
